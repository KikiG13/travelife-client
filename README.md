## Project Introduction

As a student at General Assembly I was assigned a full-stack application project for our second project assignment.  Ass someone who is passionate about traveling, I decided to create an app for recording travel destinations.  In this program you can record information about destinations you've traveled to- record the country, city, comments about them, write your favorite dish or sites, attach a photo, and give a rating. Give my application a test run and let me know what you think.
